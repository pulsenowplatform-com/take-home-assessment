        description: 'AI Core has flagged Apple\'s services segment as a key driver of margin expansion and recurring revenue quality. Geographic mix and regulatory overhang in the EU are offset by installed base growth and attach rates. The upcoming product cycle (iPhone, Vision Pro) could provide a catalyst for hardware revenue reacceleration. Sentiment is mixed on valuation; the stock often consolidates post-earnings before the next leg. Consider layering into positions on weakness with a 6–12 month horizon.',

Consider reducing leverage ahead of events, using options for defined risk, or waiting for clarity before adding size. Liquidity typically improves after the first hour of the US session post-release.',
